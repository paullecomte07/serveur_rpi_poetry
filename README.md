This python app is developed with Poetry, an easy-to-use package manager. It is a serveur running with Uvicorn proposing an Api drives by FastApi, a modern and fast (high-performance) web framework. Everything is wrapped into a docker container which is itself part of a docker compose. It could be interesting to add a lightweight database in order to store more sensors information.

I'm developing on a Raspberry Pi 3b+ with a Raspbian Buster Lite (February 2020) image.
